# BIGTREETECH-GTR-V1.0
BIGTREETECH GTR V1.0 motherboard is a high-performance 3D printer main control board with the core controller STM32F407IGT6, which was launched by the 3D printing team of ShenZhen BigTree Technology CO.,LTD ., aiming at solving some problems existing in the motherboard market. The BIGTREETECH GTR V1.0 is the motherboard, and the BIGTREETECH M5 V1.0 is the expansion board.
THIS REPOSITORY IS A COMBINATION OF Victor Oliveira / rhapsodyv Mrlin for Tronxy machines and BIGTREETECH Marlin for the GTR, where I have updated the configuration to adapt Tronxy machines to SKR and GTR boards.
